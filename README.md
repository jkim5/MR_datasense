# MR_datasense
[draft] 
For humans and the natural world alike, surveillance now extends down to the microlevel what can be subject to a logic of digitization and quantification, expanding what is sensible. The Anthropocene, however, suggests limitations in existing frameworks for data analysis and collection. To what extent have we run up against the limits of the knowable, because of an inadequacy in existing techniques to predict a changing and uncertain future and the politics that inform what questions can be asked. How are artists and researchers associated with Mississippi. An Anthropocene River project engaged in explorations of the limits of the knowable, and what role does the concept of the Anthropocene have in prompting such questioning?

This data sensing device was developed in collaboration with the Mississippi. An Anthropocene River project (https://www.hkw.de/en/programm/projekte/2018/mississippi_an_anthropocene_river/mississippi_an_anthropocene_river_start.php) and Mississippi Studies (http://mississippistudies.org/).

Works with Dweet.io (for live IOT data sharing), Freeboard.io (live data visualization of Dweet data) and SFTP (for archiving and backup).

This code was written for a device consisting of the following hardware, but the code is modular, enabling you to remove sensors depending on your needs:

* Raspberry Pi Zero (https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-zero/)
* USGlobalSat BU353-S4 USB GPS Receiver (https://www.thegpsstore.com/USGlobalSat-BU353-S4-USB-GPS-Receiver-P3219.aspx)
* 9-DOF Accel/Mag/Gyro+Temp Breakout Board - LSM9DS1 (https://www.adafruit.com/product/3387)
* BME680 - Temperature, Humidity, Pressure and Gas Sensor (https://www.adafruit.com/product/3660)
* Waterproof DS18B20 Digital temperature sensor + extras (https://www.adafruit.com/product/381)
