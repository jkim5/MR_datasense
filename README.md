For humans and the natural world alike, surveillance now extends down to the microlevel what can be subject to a logic of digitization and quantification, expanding what is sensible. The Anthropocene, however, suggests limitations in existing frameworks for data analysis and collection. To what extent have we run up against the limits of the knowable, because of an inadequacy in existing techniques to predict a changing and uncertain future and the politics that inform what questions can be asked. How are artists and researchers associated with Mississippi. An Anthropocene River project engaged in explorations of the limits of the knowable, and what role does the concept of the Anthropocene have in prompting such questioning?

The code is modular, enabling you to remove sensors depending on your needs.

Works with Dweet and FTP.

This code was written for a project consisting of the following hardware:

* Raspberry Pi Zero (https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-zero/)
* USGlobalSat BU353-S4 USB GPS Receiver (https://www.thegpsstore.com/USGlobalSat-BU353-S4-USB-GPS-Receiver-P3219.aspx)
